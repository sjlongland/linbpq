linbpq-6.0.17.1 for Debian
--------------------------

This is an unofficial distribution of John Wiseman's linbpq AX.25 software
for Debian GNU/Linux systems.  The software is installed in `/var/lib/linbpq`
with a `linbpq` user created automatically and an init script created in
`/etc/init.d/linbpq` so that the service can start at boot.

The package at this time is highly experimental, and not guaranteed to work.
